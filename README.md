# PredictingHeartDisease

The classification method, which is one of the most widely used data mining methods, has been applied to data mining. In this study, based on the data of people with heart disease, it was estimated whether a person with certain characteristics had heart disease. In the application, models were created using decision trees, regression, KNN, naive bayes, support vector machine, random forest, and the performance degrees of the models were compared. As a result of this comparison, it was determined which classification method was more successful on this database. This study was conducted with the Python Jupyter Notebook and was compared by the performance criteria of classification methods. As a result of this comparison, it was determined which classification method was more successful on this database.
